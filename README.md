# Air-BnB-and-Hotel-Market-Analysis-Dashboarding

Will analyse the Air BnB and Hotel market and will create an interactive dashboard to uncover pricing trends and neighborhood insights.

Uses https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/london-uk-airbnb-open-data 

What I will be doing:

Make a graph showing:
people with the most amount of listings
people with the highest average price (must have at least two listings)
average prices differentiated between room types
prices vs availability
prices vs minimum nights
prices vs neighbourhood
